**Unit 5: Media Systems of Asia and the South Pacific** <span
id="5"></span> 
*Media systems in Asia differ significantly from the systems you
explored in previous units.  This unit begins with an introduction of
Dr. Daya Thussu’s scholarship on globalization and its impact on media
culture in the southern regions of Asia.  Dr. Thussu’s scholarship
explores the unique cultural and political environment that influences
the establishment and regulation of media systems within Asia and the
Pacific.  We will also study Professor Joseph Man Chan’s work on Chinese
media system development under globalized media environment.  Since most
modern media systems in Asia have evolved under the influence of Western
practices, you will also learn how the media systems respond and cope
with such influences.  As we explore each country’s media systems, we
always start with relevant government regulations and then introduce
media system development under local government regulation and global
influence.*

    for International Communication: Continuity and Change”**

    *International Communication: Continuity and
    Change*”](http://lass.purduecal.edu/cca/gmj/sp03/issuebookreview/crabtree.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the book
    review.  Professor Thussu’s book, *International Communication:
    Continuity and Change*, provides important theoretical framework for
    us to understand the media system dynamics in Asian and Pacific
    countries for a good reason: it points to the process of cultural
    globalization among Asian and Pacific countries that are inevitably
    brought by globalized media as well as the concept of “contra flow,”
    a process that non-Western media organizations seek to fit in the
    existing global media landscape.  This is a book review provided by
    Professor Crabtree from Fairfield University.  From her review,
    especially how she relates the scholarship to the reflection of her
    own teaching philosophy, we may develop a sense of the value of
    Thussu’s scholarly claim.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the news
    article.  Government regulation, or government’s involvement in
    media operation is one of the four key dimensions within the Hallin
    & Mancini model.  Interestingly, according to this article, it seems
    that in India government regulation may also have an impact on level
    of journalistic professionalism, which is another key dimension in
    the same model.  Would you say that such connection between two
    dimensions has been as similar to other countries we discussed so
    far, like in Ireland or Italy?  If you were to put India within the
    Hallin & Mancini model, which model you think best approximates to
    the media system in India?

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the article. 
    Consider how the development of Bollywood has been under Western
    influence since the very beginning: the technology was brought by
    the French Lumiere Brothers in 1896.  Also consider how local film
    makers responded to western influences and create local, indigenous
    version of film entertainment.  When was the “golden age” for
    India’s Bollywood film industry?  If you are by any chance familiar
    with Indian history, what do you think were the factors contributing
    to this development?

     Instructions: Please read this article on the international success
    of the movie, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (Won’t Get Life Back Again). 
    Please go over the figures of the movie’s box revenue generated from
    its international coverage.  Ask yourself: does this mean that in
    the near future, Bollywood will compete with Hollywood?  The author
    seems to think so; do you agree?  What are the factors to be
    considered in addition to market share and box revenue, if Bollywood
    is competing with Hollywood?

     Instructions: Please click the link above and read the entire
    article.  The Broadcasting Service Act of 1992 contains an objects
    section that aims to state the goals and principles of broadcasting
    policy, and a statement of regulatory policy expressing a commitment
    to ‘light touch’ regulation intended to promote greater competition,
    new technologies, and the development of new services.  As you move
    on with your reading, please pay particular attention to specific
    requirements on Internet content hosts, ISPs, mobile carriers, and
    content service providers.  In the end, Peter Coroneos, former chief
    executive of Internet Industry Association (IIA), has described the
    IIA codes as “promoting industry facilitated user empowerment” and
    “designed to achieve the broad objectives of the legislation without
    significant burden on or damage to the industry.”  Based on what
    we’ve discussed so far on government regulations on media content
    distribution and if we compare this act with regulations published
    elsewhere, would you say that Australian government is especially
    concerned with Internet content?

    The new network service will combine the existing Australia Network
    television operation with Radio Australia’s services and the ABC’s
    online and digital operations.  Do you think such a deal will
    jeopardize diversity of media content?  What may be the rationale
    behind such government support?  If we compare this deal with the
    NBC-Comcast merger deal in the U.S., why did this deal received
    government support, instead of public skepticism?

    -   Does the International success of the Bollywood movie Zindagi Na
        Milegi Dobara (Won’t Get Life Back Again) mean that in the near
        future, Bollywood will compete directly with Hollywood?  What
        are the factors to be considered, in addition to market share
        and box revenue, if Bollywood is competing with Hollywood?
    -   What is the process of “contra flow” as described by Professor
        Thussu?  Can you find a local, relevant example that matches
        that description?
