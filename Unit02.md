**Unit 2: Global Media Conglomerates** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit introduces to you another major player within the
international media environment: global media companies.  You will take
a closer look at three of the six major global media companies: The News
Corporation, Bertelsmann AG, and Disney.  We will explore their global
business scope and their global-oriented corporate image building.  In
other words, we try to understand the purpose behind such
global-oriented corporate strategy: the pursuit of universal appeal of
their media product, so they can achieve maximum global market share
possible.  In this unit, you will also develop basic understanding of
the global business web that major global media companies have developed
over years.  The purpose of studying this global business web,
therefore, is to understand the “commercial logic” based on which the
media companies run their media business and what kind of impact it may
bring to the culture we collectively share and live within.  Finally, we
will explore some of the focal concerns relevant to multinational media
companies in regards to cultural diversity and democracy.*

    met Entrepreneurship”**
    Link: Bertelsmann AG: [“Bertelsmann at a
    Glance”](https://web.archive.org/web/20132212013500/http://www.bertelsmann.com/Investor-Relations/Bertelsmann-at-a-Glance.html)

     Instructions: Read the article, “Bertelsmann at a Glance”.  To
    complete the learning of this subunit, you need to read both this
    article and watch the corporate video, Creativity met
    Entrepreneurship, produced by Bertelsmann.  
      
     When you read the article, “Bertelsmann at a Glance,” make sure to
    read the organizational structure and strategy.  Continue to think
    about how the role of a global media enterprise, as the company
    identifies itself as such, serve in the international community?  In
    other words, to what extent can we put a “national” label on a media
    company like Bertelsmann AG?  Could we define it as German, since it
    was originated from Germany?  Or should we define it as American,
    since some of its major businesses, like Random House, is considered
    “American”?  Do those questions promote you think further of the
    Four Theories of the Press?  What are the factors we also need to
    consider when evaluating the press-government relationship, if the
    “press” now refers to a global media enterprise like Bertelsmann AG,
    while the “government” now refers to multiple hosting-country
    governments that the enterprise interacts with on daily basis?  
      
     Now move on to watch the four-minute video, “Creativity met
    Entrepreneurship.”  Click on the “play” button and watch the video. 
    Prepare yourself for a fast-paced narration of the company’s
    business scope, with focus on the global, multi-lingual, and
    multi-cultural aspect.  Bear in mind that this video was created to
    promote the company image as dynamic, modern, and global-oriented. 
    What are the benefits of this kind of corporate image?  Try to use
    the Four Theory of Press as your starting point to consider what can
    be avoided and what can be promoted for a company dealing with
    different types of political governance at the same time.

    children?  What are the universal characteristics of Disney products
    that transcends national borders?  In other words, what helps Mickey
    Mouse gain popularity in countries other than the US?  Would you say
    the Mickey Mouse’s magical power in some way resembles Bertelsmann
    AG’s effort creating a “global culture?”  So far we’ve looked at
    three major global media conglomerates.  What seems to be the shared
    purpose behind the creation of such “global perspective?” Would you
    say, in the case of Disney, that part of the intention is to benefit
    from the universal appeal of family values, in order for the company
    to achieve maximum market share possible?

     Instructions: Click on the link above and watch the PBS Frontline
    program “Merchants of Cool.”  Try reflecting back to earlier
    discussion within this chapter of media corporation’s pursuit of
    universal appeal to achieve the maximum market share possible.  Ask
    yourself: does the “coolness” mentioned in this documentary
    represent universal appeal to teenagers?  Pay particular attention
    to the third segment, “the MTV Machine.”  What was the initial
    concept of MTV?  Why does it make good “business” sense?  How does
    the MTV programming thrive upon music record companies, audiences,
    and singers alike?  Now that we know that MTV as a brand belongs to
    Viacom, one of the six major global media companies, we can get a
    better sense of how global media companies function.  Some scholars
    claim that in the age of globalization, multinational companies have
    replaced nation-state as the major players of global arena.  Would
    you agree with this ?  Why or why not?

    McChesney’s concerns?  He said that “[in] popular music, there’s a
    huge difference if you ultimately think the reason you’re listening
    to this music is because these musicians basically were hired
    because of some marketing thing.”  Reflect upon your own experience
    consuming music product.  Do you agree or disagree with McChesney on
    this?  In addition, McChesney also discussed the impact from major
    media companies, that with the powerful production and distributing
    channel, “they look at the teen market as part of this massive
    empire that they’re colonizing.”  Do you agree with McChesney that
    global media companies are “colonizing” the teen market?  Why or why
    not?
