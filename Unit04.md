**Unit 4: European Media Systems: Hallin & Mancini’s Models** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn about the major influences that shape
media systems in North and Central Europe, the North Atlantic, and the
Mediterranean.  You will be introduced to Hallin & Mancini’s comparative
media system models, which sets the research tradition for comparative
media system analysis.  The Hallin & Mancini model started this
tradition by proposing four dimensions: media market structure,
political parallelism, professionalism in journalism, and the role of
the state.  These four dimensions will be the key components within this
unit.  We will read a research article comparing online newspapers in
different European countries using the Hallin & Mancini model to develop
a sense of the four key dimensions as well as the three models
identified using the four dimensions.  We will then look into each of
the sample countries within the three models to take a close look of
their media system using the Hallin & Mancini model.  Our reading
experience will be diverse: we will read news articles as well as
encyclopedia entries when we delve into country-specific discussions.*

    or PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the research
    article.  This reading is significant for our discussion in this
    chapter for two reasons.  To begin with, this article presents a
    detailed introduction of the Hallin & Mancini comparative media
    system model, including the four major dimensions: maturity of media
    market, political parallelism, journalistic professionalism, and
    state intervention.  Secondly, this article shows us how we may use
    the Hallin & Mancini model to approach European countries’ media
    systems.  There are other important elements in the discussion as
    well, particularly in regards to the “vertical Europeanization” and
    “horizontal Europeanization” for Eastern European countries that
    joined the European Union after the 1990’s.  This reading will set
    solid foundation for us to make sense of the Hallin & Mancini model
    and capture some of the unique characteristics of European media
    systems.  It is helpful if you take notes while reading this
    article.  For example, what is the definition of the four important
    dimensions of a media system according to the Hallin & Mancini
    model?  What are the sample countries with liberal media systems? 
    What are the sample countries with Democratic-corporatist model? 
    What are the sample countries with polarized-pluralist media
    systems?

    *Guardian*”](http://www.guardian.co.uk/gnm-archive/2002/jun/06/1) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Click on the link above and read about the history of
     the *Guardian*.  We talked about the history of early American
    colonial newspapers.  When was the earliest one established? 
    According to the Hallin & Mancini comparative media system model,
    liberal countries usually feature a high degree of political
    parallelism: the degree in which the press reflects the major
    political currents in society.  The newspaper described its initial
    intention as “the paper’s intention was the promotion of the liberal
    interest in the aftermath of the Peterloo Massacre and the growing
    campaign to repeal the Corn Laws that flourished in Manchester
    during this period.”  Do you think this description fits into Hallin
    & Mancini’s liberal model?  Why or why not?  The Hallin & Mancini
    model applauds liberal countries for their strong
    professionalization of journalists.  The newspaper described its
    strategy coping with the newspaper price war in the 1990’s as
    “[remaining] at full price, investing resources in journalism and
    distancing itself from the price war through distinctive and
    innovative marketing, product development and consistently breaking
    big stories.”  Do you think this approach resonates with Hallin &
    Mancini’s liberal model?  Can you find other evidences in the
    newspaper’s history that also resonate with the liberal model?

    article about the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange.  You
    probably are familiar with the impact that Assange had on the global
    political arena with the biggest leak of secret government documents
    in history.  However, what we plan to focus on for this story is the
    liberal frame through which free, independent opinions are expressed
    by citing multiple opposing sources and caters to different interest
    groups.  What are the different interest groups?  Would you say that
    the publication of a story like this imply the “liberal” state of
    the media outlet?

    You may want to go over the characteristics of  the Polarized
    Pluralist Model before moving on.  The polarized-pluralist countries
    are characterized by a media system under the influence of an
    elite-oriented press, low newspaper circulation, and a strong
    television programming presence.  Do you think these characteristics
    are produced by the Italian media system?  What are the specific
    examples?  It is helpful if you take notes and fit in specific
    statistics or examples.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the article. 
    This article describes how the Italian media opened up after
    Berlusconi stepped down.  Some important facts to remember: what
    happened to Berlusconi’s television company, Mediaset?  What kind of
    changes took place to the voting process on the membership of
    Authority of Communications Guarantees (Agcom)?  What kind of
    political or social implications did this change have?  Answering
    these questions helps us understand that the Hallin & Mancini
    comparative media system model is not static but rather fluid; media
    systems in any given country can develop if sufficient trigger
    events occur.  Finally, notice that this is published in an Irish
    newspaper.  Where does Ireland stand in the Hallin & Mancini
    model?

    Again, taking notes while reading should help you stay on track with
    the major dimensions within the Hallin & Mancini model.  For
    instance, the Swiss film industry depends heavily on public
    subsidy.  In 2010 the Federal Office of Culture has a budget of 10.8
    million euro to support film projects.  Film makers also receive
    local government support.  How does this differ from the case of
    liberal model, like the UK or Canada, in terms of state intervention
    of market maturity?  While using Switzerland as one example,
    questions like this help you effectively evaluate media systems in
    other Central and Northern European countries where democratic
    Corporatist Model has also been identified.

    Feel free to start your own thread or respond to other students’
    postings.  

    -   What is the definition of the four important dimensions of a
        media system according to the Hallin & Mancini model?  What are
        the sample countries with liberal media systems?  What are the
        sample countries with Democratic-corporatist model?  What are
        examples of countries with polarized-pluralist media systems?
    -   The Swiss film industry depends heavily on public subsidy.  In
        2010 the Federal Office of Culture has a budget of 10.8 million
        euro to support film projects.  Film makers also receive local
        level government support.  How does this differ from the case of
        liberal model, like that of the UK or Canada in terms of state
        intervention of market maturity?
