**Unit 6: Latin American Media Systems** <span id="6"></span> 
*This unit introduces Latin American media systems as an interesting
counterpoint to Asian media systems, which you studied in Unit 5. 
Though both regions exhibit colonial influence in media content and
regulations, Latin America has distinctively different practices in
corporate regional media governances.  Many political-economic
characteristics are unique to Latin American countries.  For example,
large transnational media conglomerates are able to produce their
Spanish television programs in the United States to cater to the
Spanish-speaking communities living there, despite the sweeping
popularity of regularly televised American shows.  But does this
immediately mean that the Latin American cultural influence has won the
battle?  Introducing the concept of cultural imperialism and hegemony
may help us better understand how global influences define local media
landscapes in this region.*

    introduction on cultural imperialism, its major argument, its two
    models, contributions as well as criticism.  Please pay particular
    attention to the two ways local countries responding to such imposed
    influence, that they “either adopts this influence as a deliberate
    commercial or political strategy, or simply absorbs this influence
    unreflectively as the result of the contract.”  Use this statement
    as the key to make sense with the process of media system
    development in Latin American as we begin country-specific
    journey.

    Many believed that cultural imperialism as an academic term was
    originated form study of culture and communication discourse in
    Latin American countries.  This article situated the discussion of
    “collective identity” for the entire Latin America family in the
    context of cultural imperialism to unveil the dynamics between
    western media message and local indigenous culture.  The article
    also incorporates valuable scholarship from critical scholars like
    Dorfman and Mattelart’s (1970) on Disney: “Why is Disney a
    threat?.... [B]ecause this product of Disneyland ... is imported,
    along with so many other consumer objects, to the dependent
    country.... [B]y importing a product ... we are also importing the
    cultural forms of that society.”  While you move one with your
    reading, try keeping the definition of cultural imperialism in mind
    and take notes whenever you find something that seems interesting
    and relevant to the discussion of cultural imperialism.

**6.1.3 The Myth of Cultural Imperialism: Cases Beyond the Theory**

    Imperialism”**

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the article. 
    Some of the critics that cultural imperialism usually receives are
    that usually the responses from local community have been ignored. 
    This delicious piece of reading provided several interesting cases
    in which local communities reacts to incoming American commercial
    cultural icons, including the difficult landing of Disneyland Theme
    Park in Paris and fierce reaction against American’s attempts at
    opening Brazil’s local computer market, when President Reagan
    depicted as Rambo, “slamming Brazilian President José Sarney over
    the head with a computer.”  After this reading, you should have a
    good idea of cultural imperialism, its theoretical claim and how it
    may relate to real-life examples.  We will then discuss the case of
    Brazil to further understand the concept of cultural imperialism.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the overview
    of media development in Brazil.  This overview provides information
    on commercial media, public media, and community based media and
    capacity of professional training.  Please also pay attention to the
    fact that due to historical reasons, media ownership in Brazil is
    highly concentrated.  Keep these in mind as we move on with a
    discussion and analysis of this country.

    Cinema”](http://www.scribd.com/doc/47983669/Pop-Culture-Latin-America) (HTML
    or PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and jump to page 240
    using the box on the top of the page to read Chapter 10 and Chapter
    11.  Pay particular attention to facts relevant to concentration of
    media ownership, as well as the western influence on indigenous
    culture in Brazil.  Some argue that since the programs produced by
    TV Globo, Brazil’s largest TV program producer have been exported to
    more than 130 countries, influence of cultural imperialism gradually
    disappeared as Brazil is exporting TV programs to the outside
    world.  Do you agree with this argument or not?  Take a closer look
    at the picture on page 244, for example, in which Brazilian singer,
    actress, and television phenomenon Xuxa posts in front of the
    camera.  Pay attention to the way she presented herself and ask what
    type of message she was trying to send to her audience.  Do you
    think the program is truly Brazilian or is in fact an American
    version of Brazil?  Move on with your reading of both chapters
    following this pattern.  Always look for traces to understand how
    local media respond to American commercial cultural influence.  
      
     Reading these chapters should take approximately 4 hours.

    Pay attention to a series of merger and corporation between Televisa
    and other major media corporations around the world, including
    Univision, NBC, and Sky.  What does this imply in terms of the
    global impact it may produce through such enhanced distribution
    channel?  Relating back to the discussion in previous chapter, does
    such enhanced distribution always suggest greater presence of
    authentic Latin American culture?

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the news
    article.  This story provides an overview of the alleged scandal in
    which Mexico’s presidential candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador,
    has been charged of purchasing favorable coverage on Mexico’s
    biggest television network, Televisa.  As the last piece of reading
    material in Unit 6, this story reminds us the complicated picture
    among Latin America countries that reflects both highly concentrated
    media ownership and historically strong cultural influence coming
    from the West.  Such complexity in part triggered political dynamics
    described in news stories like this.  Try connecting the dots as you
    read the story and see if you can come up with your insight of the
    situation: what have been the major social, cultural, and political
    forces behind the scene?

    -   What is the definition of cultural imperialism?  Try to relate

        scholarship on Disney, where they argue ask: “why is Disney a
        threat?.... [B]ecause this product of Disneyland ... is
        imported, along with so many other consumer objects, to the
        dependent country.... [B]y importing a product ... we are also
