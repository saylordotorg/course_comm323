    section.  The evolution of the Internet challenged most existing
    roles and the influence of stakeholders in the media system.  How

    medium?  How would journalists and news anchors redefine their
    profession in response to the changing technology?  If you use the
    classic Hallin & Mancini media system model to approach the changing
    media landscape because of the introduction of the Internet, you may
    realize how these big questions need to be re-examined.  This
    session will introduce to you the evolution of the Internet since
    “Web 1.0.”

    -   The evolution of the Internet challenged most existing roles or
        influences of stakeholders in our media system.  How would the
        government, for instance, coordinate and balance the
        media-government relationship?  How do media consumers to
        continuously shape and influence the media market?
    -   Do you believe that major social media sites: (Google, Apple,
        Twitter, and Facebook) are the new information gatekeepers?  In
        other words, is the old market rule identified through Hallin &
        Mancini model within media systems valid in the age of the new
        media?

    Posting and responding on the discussion board should take
