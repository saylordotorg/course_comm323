Course Syllabus for "COMM323: Comparative Media Systems"
---------------------------------------------------------

Whether you know it or not, you are actively contributing to a
comprehensive media environment forged on both regional and global
levels – even when you are privately using social media websites!  The
media we use today has come a long way, but the basic pattern of
development remains consistent.  This course introduces various academic
theories, cases, and models to make sense of local and global media
development.  How does a locally operated newspaper trigger development
of the national mass media market?  How does a global conglomerate media
company set agendas for international news distribution?  Consider how
the following historical events may be connected:
1.  In 1833, The Sun, a New York-based newspaper, became available to
    the general public for the first time.  This marked the beginning of
    the mass production of information and created a market sector that
    could be influenced by average people.
2.  In 1995, conglomerate media company, News Corporation, headquartered
    in New York City, acquired the Hong Kong-based television network,
    Star TV.  This groundbreaking acquisition expanded News Corp.’s
    influence at an international level.
3.  In 2005, New York-based journalist, Arianna Huffington, launched The
    Huffington Post, branded as “The Internet Newspaper.”  Huffington’s
    free newspaper utilized innovations such as user-contributed content
    and the rejection of information “gatekeeping.”
4.  Also in 2005, the Chinese television show, Super Girl, had
    remarkable success when the season finale commanded the attention of
    400 million viewers – a profoundly high viewership within the
    strictly governed Chinese media system.

How should we assess the impact of these events on local and global
scales?  In this course, we will explore the ways stakeholders influence
the media environment we live in today.  On local levels, we will
discuss how media evolves under mass market and political influences,
and during economic development.  On the global level, we will analyze
global media conglomerates’ agendas for international news distribution.
 Further, you will critically examine the ways new media technology
allows the general population to access and actively contribute to
social media content.  Selected theories and models of regional media
systems are also examined in this course.  The thread between the
aforementioned events will be illuminated throughout this course, and
you will be asked to analyze the socio-cultural impact of each item.
This comparative media course also provides a working knowledge of how
media are operated and regulated under varied political and economic
influences.
