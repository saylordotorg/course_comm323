**Unit 8: African Media Systems** <span id="8"></span> 
*This unit focuses on media infrastructures of various African nations
within the context of developmental theory, which puts great emphasis on
partnership and adoption of new technologies.  This unit will also
introduce a competing theory, neo-colonialism, from critical approach to
point out potential negative impact on African countries from receiving
foreign aid.  All of the African nations discussed in this unit are
former colonies of Western nations.  This course will introduce
neo-colonialism to illustrate how these countries construct national
identities under colonial influence and how the establishment of modern
media is important.*

    Our discussion of African media begins with the topic of HIV/AIDS
    and how it has been highly politicized in African mainstream media. 
    This article cites several influential factors that have shaped
    media coverage of HIV/AIDS, including social movements and
    nation-states, which partly resonate with the Hallin & Mancini model
    of comparative media systems.

    distinctive eras of development theory at the United Nations: from
    “national state capitalism” to “sustainable development.”

     Instructions: Please click on the link and read this article, which
    presents a competing critical theory about economic development in
    African countries.  It might be useful to see how this alternative
    argument has been constructed when approaching foreign aid from
    institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
    particularly when it comes to the potential negative influences on
    domestic affairs in African countries.  Understanding these
    alternate arguments about neo-colonialism might be helpful when
    developing an overall picture of media development in African
    countries.

    developments can coexist in African countries?

    points out another aspect of the Egyptian Media Development Program:
    its emphasis on training journalists.  Recall the Hallin & Mancini
    comparative media model and its discussion of journalistic

    European countries such as Italy?  At the beginning of this unit, we
    mentioned the pros and cons of foreign aid in developing African
    infrastructures, including media infrastructure.  Does foreign aid
    contribute to the effectiveness of training programs like this?

    the article’s claim that “the case of Ethiopia is proof that in
    spite of the political repression, media will continue to play a
    significant role in democratization”?

    journalism in the two countries?  For instance, Ethiopia emphasizes
    citizen journalism and emancipation.  How does this differ from the
    Media Development Program in Egypt?
