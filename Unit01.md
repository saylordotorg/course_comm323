**Unit 1: Media Systems Within the United States** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to a working definition of the
term “media systems.” Media system can be generally understood as
network of mass media outlets, including TV, radio, newspaper, and the
Internet in a given national context; moreover, media system also refers
to the complicated relationship among such mass media outlets and the
society where they were established and operated. With this in mind, it
makes sense to conceptualize the term with a group of intersecting areas
of study that incorporate political science, sociology, and economics.
At the beginning of this unit, we will introduce two foundational
theoretical frameworks in comparative media study that each offers you
comprehensive view of media system and the group of intertwining
influences. You will learn about the foundation scholarship published in
the Four Theories of the Press, published in 1963, which set forth four
media system models, each situated in unique political and social
environment.  
  
 Following an introduction of these two theoretical frameworks, you will
begin the exploration with an overview of media development in the
United States. You will learn about the age of yellow journalism, mass
distribution of newspapers, and the establishment of the Associated
Press – one of the oldest news agencies in the world. This unit also
focuses on the ways printed media promotes social change, which in turn,
supports media development. Such mutual influence and close relationship
resonates with both theoretical framework we read earlier in the unit,
and lays the groundwork for your understanding of media system evolution
within particular national contexts. Later in this course, this
foundational knowledge will enable you to effectively compare and
contrast a variety of media systems.*

**1.2 Early Newspapers in the United States** <span id="1.2"></span> 
**1.2.1 Colonial American Newspapers** <span id="1.2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: *Understanding Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass
    Communication*: “Section 4.1 History of Newspaper”**
    Link: *Understanding Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass
    Communication*: [“Section 4.1 History of
    Newspaper”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/Understanding%20Media%20and%20Culture.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read “Section
    4.1”.  As you read through this chapter, pay attention to the
    correlation between newspaper development and political influence in
    the U.S.  For example, early colonial newspapers typically excluded
    political content to avoid confrontation from colonial authorities.
     The close ties between politics and press that are presented in
    this reading should encourage you to continue your reflection on
    media systems within the framework of the Four Theories of the
    Press.  
      
     Note: This reading also covers the information outlined in
    sub-subunits 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.3.1, and 1.3.2.  
      
     Reading this section should take approximately 1 hour.

**1.2.2 The Trial of John Peter Zenger** <span id="1.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below sub-subunit
1.2.1.  
  
 Focus on the text below the heading, “the trial of John Peter Zenger,”
as well as “Freedom of the Press in the early United States,” which come
right after the section on “Colonial American Newspapers.”  During this
monumental trial, John Peter Zenger, founder of the New York Weekly
Journal, a publication that openly criticizes the newly appointed
colonial governor, faced charges of producing “scandalous, virulent,
false and seditious reflections” in his papers.  Zenger’s verdict marked
changes in the press-government relationship: instead of avoiding
political content, newspapers began to target political figures and
openly shared editorial comments on current political issues.  Such
increased freedom of the press, in return, played an influential role in
the independent war and formation of political parties.*

**1.3 Newspapers as a Form of Mass Media** <span id="1.3"></span> 
**1.3.1 The Penny Press: The Sun** <span id="1.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below sub-subunit
1.2.1.  
  
 Focus on the text below the heading “Newspapers as a form of mass
media,” which includes sections on “the Penny Press” and “growth of wire
services.”  The introduction of the penny press set a unique historical
stage for the newspaper to be treated as a commodity and a vehicle for
political discussion.  While completing this reading consider the new
dynamics within the government-press relationship.  Why was the penny
press much more successful than its predecessors?  What are the
approaches or focuses they chose to adopt?  To what degree should a
market be matured enough, in terms of both depth and scope, to support a
penny press like this?*

**1.3.2 Public Taste Gone Wild: Yellow Journalism** <span
id="1.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below sub-subunit
1.2.1.  
  
 Focus on the text below the heading, “Yellow Journalism” and “comics
and stunt journalism,” which comes right after “growth of wire
services.”  As you move on with the reading of the US newspaper history,
ask yourself: what is the definition of the term sensationalism in this
context?  Why did stories focused on crime, violence, emotion, and sex
in the early 1800’s enjoy such popularity in the press?  How does this
connect to the emergence of newspaper as a form of mass media and the
maturity of the mass media market as we discussed earlier in 1.3.1? 
This session marks the end of our reading on early US newspaper
history.*

**1.3.3 The Associated Press** <span id="1.3.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Associated Press: “AP’s History”**
    Link: The Associated Press: [“AP’s
    History”](http://www.ap.org/company/history/ap-history) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to read the history of
    the Associated Press – one of the world’s oldest news agencies,
    established in 1846.  Several journalists who have worked for the
    Associated Press have won the Pulitzer Prize, which is considered as
    the highest level of professional recognition in journalism.  You
    will also learn how AP journalists have had to adapt to advancing
    technology in writing and new distribution.  While completing this
    reading, further consider the framework of the Four Theories of the
    Press.  Which theories are most prominently reflected in the
    development of the Associated Press?

    *New York Times*’ editorial decision-making, especially during the
    1993 debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
    when the newspaper was criticized for exercising editorial control
    over information.  Consider this reading within the context of the
    two theoretical frameworks introduced earlier in this unit.

    13.1”.  As you complete this reading, pay particular attention to
    the three major media business models: monopoly, oligopoly, and
    monopolistic competition.  What are the specific conditions they
    each require?  How might they impact media content and
    distribution?  Can you think of any real life examples?  This
    chapter will highlight how the media market and media business model
    may impact individual media outlets as well as the overall media
    system, which will serve as a good reminder for us to relate to
    factors coming from outside of government policies and regulations
    on media development.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read through all
    of Chapter 7 to get an overview of radio as a mass medium.  Please
    pay attention to radio’s impact on culture: radio was such an
    influential medium during the 1930s; so much so, that many people
    believed that a radio program based on Well’s science fiction novel
    of invading aliens was actual news broadcasting, which produced
    social unrest.  Also, pay attention to radio’s new future with the
    introduction of the Internet.  Once again, we need to tie the
    learning experience back to the Four Theories of the Press: the
    development of radio as a mass media offered us a good example to
    see the importance of social responsibility and how it should, and
    can, be regulated.

    2007.  Ultimately, this strike resulted in a new trend of delivering
    content through web-based channels, like iTunes and Hulu.  As you
    complete this reading, please pay attention to some of the unique
    trends in the TV industry, including corporate sponsorship, public
    television, and cable TV network.  Also, pay attention to new
    trends, including iTV, Hulu, and YouTube.  The variety shows us how
    the TV industry responds to an ever-changing media market.

    opportunity to review what you learned in this unit.  Consider the
    following questions as you read: can you relate the information to
    the Four Theories of the Press?   In the context of media industry
    competition models, is the merger producing a monopoly, an
    oligopoly, or monopolistic competition?  Finally, what is the role
    of the FCC in this case, and was it effective?  You should be able
    to support your reasoning with examples.
