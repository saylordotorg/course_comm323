     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this
    article.  This reading provides us with an audience perspective. 
    Please pay close attention to the following statement: “in 1940 news
    travelled the Arab world via word-of-mouth, which was the primary
    source of news for most Arabs, but by 2000 Arabs had gained access
    to radios, newspapers, the Internet and as many as 60 satellite TV
    channels.”  This statement describes changes to the Middle East’s
    media audience within a time-span of 60 years.  How do these changes
    correlate with the changing political landscape of the Middle East? 
    If you continue with your analysis using the four dimensions within
    the Hallin & Mancini comparative media model, would you conclude
    that political parallelism and government involvement should be
    considered as the primary influence when it comes to media
    development in the Middle East?

    receive relatively less attention?

    We know how the Middle Eastern audience changed the way they consume
    media; we also know that media structure in Middle Eastern countries
    has exhibited somewhat unbalanced development.  How does the case of
    social media and satellite TV in Egypt contribute to the current
    discussion?  In other words, would you say that this explains why
    the media structure in the Middle East is unbalanced?

    society outside of the newsroom?
