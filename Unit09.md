**Unit 9: International Organizations** <span id="9"></span> 
*After the close examinations of local and regional media systems
conducted in the previous units, this unit will focus on the global
level as we discuss the responsibilities, policies, and projects of
influential international organizations.  Through discussion of their
policy and recent projects, we will come to understand how such policies

they influence local news agendas and the flow of information.*
