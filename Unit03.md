**Unit 3: North American Media Systems** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit offers a comparison between media systems based in Canada and
the United States.  You will engage with material that presents the
roles of government support and involvement in the establishment and
distribution of media and content production in Canada.  Specifically,
we explore the Canadian Broadcasting System (CBS), the national media
outlet that functions as a corporation, but also under close government
regulation.  We will also examine a range of independent interests
groups, like the Canadian Radio-television and Tele-communications
Commission (CRTC)  and the Competition Bureau.  You will also be
introduced to the liberal model within the Hallin & Mancini comparative
media system model, which approximates media system in Canada, the UK,
Ireland, and the USA; at the same time, you will also watch documentary
in which leading critical scholars of our time, Edward Herman, Noam
Chomsky, and Justin Lewis expressing their concerns of the notion of
“liberal media” and its impact on democracy.*

    highlights” link on this webpage to expand the content to its full
    scope.  Canadian media systems differs from that of the U.S.  The
    national Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), while operating as
    a corporation, is under government regulation at the same time.  Our
    discussion of the Canadian media system, therefore, will closely
    examine the consequence and rationale of such government-media
    relationship.  As you move on with the reading of the history of the
    CBC, try if you can find answers to the following questions:
    Canadian radio listeners began their media experience by tuning in
    to American radio programs.  What kind of impact might this bring to
    Canadian media development, and the country’s cultural and national
    identity?  Do you think the Canadian government worried about this
    influence?  If so, what kind of government policies or regulations
    have been implemented during critical phases of media technology
    advancement, say, when television was introduced in the 1950’s and
    when digital media was introduced in the 2000’s?  What kind of
    corporate strategy has been implemented during those critical
    phases?

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the web
    page.  Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission
    (CRTC) is an independent public organization that regulates and
    supervises the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications
    systems.  The organization represents the interests of citizens,
    industries, interest groups, and the government, then report to
    Parliament through the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  To continue
    our discussion on government-media relationships, please pay special
    attention on the recommendation to telecommunications and
    broadcasting licensing and the foreign capital merger with Canadian
    communications company.  What have been the rationale behind such
    regulations?  Now reflect upon subunit 1.4.2, where we reviewed the
    responsibilities of Federal Communication Commission (FCC) of the
    U.S.  What have been the similarities and differences?  Can you find
    expectations on licensing and foreign entity merger with domestic
    communications companies that is as explicit and strict?  What does
    this difference say about the American influence we talked about
    earlier this chapter to Canadian media market?

    “2015: Everyone, Every Way.”  Relate the several key points the
    CBC/Radio-Canada’s President & CEO, Hubert T. Lacroix mentioned
    throughout the video clip.  Why these points are important to CBC? 
    So far we discussed the influence from U.S. media, concerns of
    foreign ownership, and cross-media ownership.  We also explore
    several stakeholders, including independent interests group like
    Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission,
    independent law enforcement agency like the Competition Bureau and
    the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which function as corporation
    but also receives close government regulation.  All those
    discussions paint for us a complex picture in which the
    government-media relationship has been different from what we have
    in the U.S.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the blog
    entry.  This blog follows the Hallin & Mancini comparative media
    system model to categorize Canada, the UK, Ireland, and the U.S. as
    North Atlantic Model based on commercialization of the press,
    connection between ruling parties and the media, and
    professionalization of journalistic practice.  After close
    examination of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, we might reach
    at a conclusion that although Canada and the U.S. media system are
    both under the “liberal model,” they also differ from each other,
    particularly in regards to the extent to what government choose to
    involve in regulating media content distribution and ownership, as
    well as the degree to what various stakeholders will involve in the
    decision-making process on how the media should move forward in an
    ever changing world.  As you finish reading this blog, which was
    written by a university senior student, ask yourself: what are the
    evidences cited here between the U.S. and Canada have been relevant
    to you?  Which arguments don’t seem convincing to you?  Why?

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and watch the
    interview and analysis from Edward Herman from Wharton Business
    School of University of Pennsylvania, Justin Lewis from University
    of Massachusetts, and Noam Chomsky from the Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology, three of the leading critical scholars of our time.” 
    Although their discussion was not specifically situated within the
    Hallin & Mancinni comparative media system model, they nonetheless
    mention some of the important issues relating to the
    government-media dynamics.  For instance, why did Professor Herman
    stated that the media in our time have been “voice for the elite?”  
    Why did Professor Chomsky argued that “if you want to know how a
    system works, you look at its institutional structure... how it is
    organized, how it is controlled, how it is funded, so on?”  What
    kind of argument are they trying to establish, or critiques they are
    trying to provide against the existing notion of “liberal media”? 
    Watch the rest of the interview with those questions.  Use this
    documentary as a cornerstone to summarize our discussion this
    chapter on Canadian media system, government-media relationship and
    legislature on media ownership.  Finally, see if you can come up
    with our own answer to this question: why is the notion of “liberal
    media” considered be a myth?  Do you agree with this or not?  Why?
